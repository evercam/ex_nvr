# ExNVR

NVR (Network Video Recorder) for Elixir using [Membrane Framework](https://github.com/membraneframework)

![ExNVR dashboard](/screenshots/ex_nvr.png)

## Installation

To get started with `ex_nvr` it's preferrable and easy to run a docker image:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/evercam/ex_nvr:latest
```

Or create a new image using the Dockerfile. Run the following command from the root folder of the project
```bash
docker build -t ex_nvr:custom .
```

This will create an image `ex_nvr` with `custom` tag. To run it, issue this command:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 --env-file .env ex_nvr:custom
```

### Arm/v7
There's currently no automated docker build for `arm/v7` since building the image using `buildx` and `Qemu` take ages to complete,
the workaroud is to build the image on the target host itself

```bash
docker build -t ex_nvr:0.1.1 -f Dockerfile-armv7 .
```

Note that running the docker cotainer needs some environment variables defined in the `.env` file. The list of environment 
variables needed to configure `ex_nvr` are:

| **Env variable** | **descritpion** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| DATABASE_PATH    | The path where Sqlite database will be created. |
| EXNVR_HLS_DIRECTORY | The directory where hls playlists will be stored. Defaults to: `./hls`. <br/><br/>It is not necessary to expose this folder via volumes since the playlists are deleted each time the user stop streaming.
| EXNVR_ADMIN_USERNAME | The username(email) of the admin user to create on first startup. Defaults to: `admin@localhost`. |
| EXNVR_ADMIN_PASSWORD | The password of the admin user to create on first startup. Defaults to: `P@ssw0rd`. |
| SECRET_KEY_BASE  | A 64 byte key that's used by **Pheonix** to encrypt cookies |
| EXNVR_URL | The `url` to use for generating URLs and as a default value for `check_origins` of the websocket. Defaults to: `http://localhost:4000` |
| EXNVR_HTTP_PORT | Http `port`, defaults to: `4000` |
| EXNVR_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS | A space separated allowed origins for `CORS` requests. defaults to: `*` |
| EXNVR_ENABLE_HTTPS | Enable `https`, default: `false` |
| EXNVR_HTTPS_PORT | Https `port`, defaults to: `443` |
| EXNVR_SSL_KEY_PATH | The path to the SSL key. |
| EXNVR_SSL_CERT_PATH | The path to the SSL certificate. |
| EXNVR_JSON_LOGGER | Enable json logging, defaults to: `true` |

* **WebRTC Configuration**

| **Env variable** | **descritpion** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| EXTERNAL_IP | The external IP address to which attach the turn server. Defaults to: `127.0.0.1` |
| VIRTUAL_HOST | The TURN server domain name. Defaults to: `localhost` |
| INTEGRATED_TURN_PORT_RANGE | UDP port range to use for WebRTC communication. The number of ports in the range decides the total number of users that can stream at the same time. Defaults to: `30000-30100` |
| INTEGRATED_TURN_TCP_PORT | TCP port of TURN server. Defaults to: `20000` |
| INTEGRATED_TURN_PKEY | Private key to use for TURN server. If not provided, TURN will not handle TLS connections. Defaults to: `nil` |
| INTEGRATED_TURN_CERT | Certificate to use for TURN server. If not provided, TURN will not handle TLS connections. Defaults to: `nil` |

> *Note*
> 
> Actually even if private and certificate files are provided, TURN server will not handle TLS connections. We'll support this in the near future.

## Features

The main feature of this project is to store video streams retrieved from `devices` to local file system and allow users to stream back those recorded videos.  

* **Devices**: read video streams from
   - [x] IP Cameras
   - [ ] USB / Webcams
   - [ ] Raspberry Cameras
   - [x] Plain RTSP stream
   - [ ] File Upload (Helpful for debug, benchmarking & demos)

* **Camera Streams**: save and playback
   - [x] Main stream
   - [ ] Sub-stream

* **Device Discovery**: discover devices
   - [x] Onvif discovery

* **Video Codecs**: allow storing and streaming videos with following codecs
   - [x] H264
   - [ ] H265

* **Streaming**: live view and playback
   - [x] HLS
   - [ ] WebRTC
   - [ ] Webm
   - [ ] RTSP
   - [ ] RTMP

* **Integration**: Integrate with third party software
   - [ ] Web Hooks: Notify external services of new recorded videos
   - [x] Unix-domain Socket: Send snapshots via unix-domain socket 

* **Other**: other interesting features
   - [ ] Support audio
   - [x] Support multiple devices in same instance
   - [x] Get snapshot from live/recorded stream
   - [x] Download videos of arbitrary durations
   - [ ] Add stats/info about streams (for devs)
   - [x] API / API documentation
   - [ ] Gather metrics
   - [ ] Run machine learning models on video streams (live video / stored footages)
   - [ ] Sync recorded videos to cloud storage
   - [ ] Application for management of multiple NVRs
   - [x] Support HTTPS
