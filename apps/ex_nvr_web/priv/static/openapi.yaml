        By default, there'll be no transcoding since we currently only support H264, the stream is 
        muxed as it is into fMP4 files.

        If the device has sub stream provided, the manifest will also contain the lower resolution.

        For playback, only the high resolution stream can be provided, since we don't support storing
        sub-streams to file system.

        if the `stream` query parameter is provided, only the requested stream will be included in the 
        manifest. 
        
        Note that we don't do any checks on the existence of the requested stream (e.g. if you

        ### Duration and End date
        
        In addition to the query parameter `start_date` which is required, either `end_date` 
        or `duration` should be provided.

        If the `end_date` is provided, the total time between `start_date` and `end_date` should be within 
        2 hours.

        ### Downloaded Footage Start Date
        
        Note that for this endpoint to be efficient, there's no transcoding done 
        to the recorded footage. So the start date of the downloaded video may not
        be the same as the requested one through `start_date` since we need to 
        start the footage from the nearest keyframe before the provided start date.

        ### Recording Discontinuity

        A discontinuity in the recorded videos may be present due to several reasons (e.g. lost 
        connection to the camera, NVR reboot, ...etc.). In this case the video duration may not be 
        the one expected.

        In the case `end_date` is provided, the interval between `start_date` and `end_date` will be greater
        or equal to the duration of the downloaded video

        In the case `duration` is provided, the end date reported in the downloaded video may be far from 
        the `start_date + duration`.

        ## Event Types
        ### LPR
        Some IP Cameras has support for `LPR` (License Plate Recognizer) and they can be configured to 
        push event via webhook in realtime. Since each camera event has a different schema, we have parsers 
        for each type of IP Camera that we need to support.

        Currently we support the following camera:
          * Milesight

        ## Authorization
        Since event are pushed by third party systems, we need to authenticate this requests. For this
        we need to create a `webhook` token. A webhook token has no expiry date and only authorize this 
        endpoint.

        The webhook token should be sent in the `Authorization` header (recommneded) or as a query param `token`.
        ```
        curl -XPOST http://my.server/api/devices/:device_id/events?event_type=lpr&token=mytoken
